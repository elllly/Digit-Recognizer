# Digit Recognizer

Overview:
---------
This repository contains the code and documentation for my participation in the Kaggle competition: Digit Recognizer. The primary goal of the competition was to develop a model for recognizing handwritten digits.

Key Features:
--------------
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Merged three layers of convolution with max pooling for enhanced digit recognition. Leveraged the power of CNNs to capture hierarchical features in the image data.

- Model Performance: Attained a significant accuracy milestone of 98.017% on the test data, showcasing the effectiveness of the developed model in accurately classifying handwritten digits.

Dependencies:
--------------
- Python 3.10
- TensorFlow
- Keras
